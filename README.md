### CIFAR-10 Image Classification using TensorFlow

This project demonstrates image classification on the **CIFAR-10 dataset** using **TensorFlow and Keras**. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

#### Key Features:

* ✅ Data preprocessing and normalization
* 🧠 Building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
* 📊 Model training, validation, and accuracy tracking
* 🖼️ Visualization of predictions and test results
* 📈 Evaluation of performance and prediction accuracy

#### Dataset:

* CIFAR-10: Contains labeled images in 10 classes: `airplane`, `automobile`, `bird`, `cat`, `deer`, `dog`, `frog`, `horse`, `ship`, `truck`.

#### Technologies Used:

* Python
* TensorFlow / Keras
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
